Create basic queries:
- Standard Create
- Standard Read
- Standard Update
- Standard Delete

Based on the common values we would manipulate these from.

Determine host and set up MySQL server within it.
- Look at the documentation for Blazor.
- Need to know the standard ones that are typically connected to.
- This will allow for us to follow pre-documented procedures easily.

Create separate class objects for each table needed.
- Each attribute of that class are the columns of that table.

Decide on the information we need to store and insert dummy values into the tables.
- This will allow for us to run a test sample program.
- We will need to edit it to match the front-end.

Create the basic connector database object.
- It will allow for the handling of the files seemlessly.
- This handles the connection to the DB and to run the queries back and forth.

Once we've figured out the host and set up the server, make sure you download the right library to handle the connection.
